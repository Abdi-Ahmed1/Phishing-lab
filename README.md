# Cybersecurity Project: Phishing Attack Demonstration

## Description

This repository contains a demonstration of a phishing attack script implemented as a cybersecurity project. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills and understanding of cybersecurity principles, particularly in the area of phishing attacks and awareness.

The script demonstrates a simulated phishing attack scenario in a controlled test environment. It is designed to help users understand the techniques employed by malicious actors and to raise awareness about the importance of vigilance and proper security practices.

The initial code was inspired by an old GitHub project called "blackeye" [https://github.com/An0nUD4Y/blackeye]. However, I encountered issues with the project and I made some changes to the code where I removed all the choices and added my tag called AA Warzone and more.
